# ReAccess AI Documentation
A form is synonymous to a page inside ReAccess.  It will house the data elements you wish to collect which aer called controls.  Here we will create the Form tab data elements.

  On the Forms tab the document must contain the following columns and make them bold if possible.  Anything with an asterisk is required from the user.  
    Also, tags are seperated by semicolons.  If an icon is not provided, use "Page" as the default.

    Form Tab Columns:

    A:  Name*
    B:  Scope*
    C   Tags*
    D:  Description*
    E:  ImportData
    F:  Icon*
    G:  Header
    H:  Footer
    I:  Integration Code
    J:  Sort Order*
    K:  Data Display Name
