# ReAccess AI Introduction
The AI Documentation is meant to help both the user and AI to build out an Excel file which is used to create a new ReAccess app.

## Steps

1.  To create an importable Excel document that ReAccess can consume there must be three tabs in the Document.  

    Tabs:
    1.  Application
    2.  Forms
    3.  Controls


2.  For the Application tab the document must contain the following columns and make them bold if possible.  Anything with an asterisk is required from the user.  
    Also, tags are seperated by  semicolons.  If an icon is not provided, use "Home" as the default.

    Application Tab Columns:
    1.  Name*
    2.  HomePageContent
    3.  Tags*
    4.  Description*
    5.  Icon
